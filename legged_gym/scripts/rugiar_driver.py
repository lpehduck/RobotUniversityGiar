"""
Policy-switching demo, built on legged_gym/control/ (SimAdapter, PolicySupervisor,
SafetyGovernor, ControlService — see legged_gym/control/ARCHITECTURE.md for the
full area map, entry points, and the Collaboration Boundaries section on what's
safe to touch here without coordinating with other areas).

This script is the "supervised from a web UI, in simulation" corner of the
control architecture. All robot control (policy switching, pause/restart,
E-STOP, velocity commands) lives in the unified control web (web/index.html,
served at --control_port) via ControlService/ControlServer — the same
methods an autonomous Selector loop or, eventually, a networked bridge to a
real robot would call. viser here is ONLY the 3D scene renderer plus its own
native camera controls — it has no robot-control GUI of its own; that would
just be a second, unsynchronized copy of what the unified web already does.

Building a custom controller (gamepad, custom hardware, a phone app) against
--control_port's WebSocket protocol instead of using the web UI? See
docs/index.html's "Talking to the robot: the control protocol" section
(id=control-protocol) for the full wire format, and examples/joystick_controller.py
for a working reference client.

This is the driver for the "g1" (walking) family of tasks — a registered task
here is treated as a separate EXPERIMENT, not a live mode to hot-swap within
one process (see the "Family selector" plan and its follow-up discussion for
why: Genesis can't rebuild its scene in-process, and more importantly, the
user explicitly wants experiments kept architecturally separate, not unified
into one policy). `legged_gym/scripts/rugiar_driver_target.py` is the sibling
driver for the "target-aware" family (g1_target and future siblings) — same
plumbing, plus the per-tick target-bearing injection that family's tasks
expect. The control web's Family panel switches between them by relaunching
the correct one for the chosen task — see _relaunch_for_family()/
_script_for_task() below.

Usage:
    python legged_gym/scripts/rugiar_driver.py \
        --policy stable:/path/to/unitree_rl_gym/deploy/pre_train/g1/motion.pt \
        --policy crouch:logs/g1/<run>/exported/policy_lstm_1.pt \
        --active stable

DUPLICATION WARNING: rugiar_driver_target.py is a largely-duplicated sibling of
this file, not a caller of it (see above for why). Standalone helper
functions shared verbatim between the two (_encode_camera_frame_jpeg,
parse_policy_args, _sibling_meta_simulator, _script_for_task,
_bare_g1_policy_specs, _spawn_or_exec, _relaunch_for_family,
_sibling_meta_task, drain_finished_training) are checked for drift
automatically by tests/test_driver_family_parity.py — if you change one of
those here, that test will fail until you mirror the change into
rugiar_driver_target.py too.
main() itself is NOT covered by that test (the target driver legitimately
interleaves target-aware obs injection into it) — if you change non-target
control flow inside main() here (argparse setup, policy loading,
supervisor/safety setup, ControlServer/web mount setup, the restart/
family-switch/training-poll main loop, camera frame capture/publish), mirror
that change into rugiar_driver_target.py's main() by hand.
