"""
Third sibling driver: the same policy-switching / pause-restart / E-STOP /
live-telemetry control session as legged_gym/scripts/rugiar_driver.py, but
driving an **mjlab** (MuJoCo Warp) task instead of a Genesis one — phase 5
of docs/mjlab_migration.md.

Everything above the adapter is reused UNCHANGED: ControlService,
ControlServer (the same JSON-over-WebSocket protocol at /ws), the same
web/index.html UI on the same --control_port, PolicySupervisor's cross-fade
switching, SafetyGovernor's fall/NaN trip. The only genuinely new code is:
env construction (mjlab's registry + our own Rugiar-G1-Mimic task from the
repo-root mjlab_tasks/ package), MjlabAdapter
(legged_gym/control/mjlab_adapter.py), and the viewer bridge below.

Two things differ from its Genesis siblings, both structural:

1. **It runs in a different interpreter.** mjlab lives in `.venv-mjlab`
   (incompatible mujoco pin, plus an `rsl_rl` name collision with this
   repo's vendored copy — docs/mjlab_migration.md R1). Hence the sys.path
   reorder at the top of this file, and hence _relaunch_for_family() in
   BOTH directions picking an interpreter, not just a script.

2. **The viewer owns the loop, not us.** mjlab ships its own viser viewer
   (mjlab.viewer.viser.ViserPlayViewer — verified by reading
   .venv-mjlab/.../mjlab/viewer/viser/viewer.py; it takes an optional
   `viser_server`, which is how this file pins it to --viser_port), and
   that viewer's `run()` IS the sim loop: it calls `policy(obs)` and then
   `env.step()` itself, with its own real-time budget accumulator. So
   instead of our own `while True`, the per-tick control work
   (drain_commands -> service.tick -> publish_status) lives in the policy
   callback below — which the viewer calls on its own main thread, so
   ARCHITECTURE.md's hard invariant ("every ControlService call except the
   four cheap flag-setters must go through ControlServer's command queue,
   drained once per sim tick") is satisfied exactly as it is in
   rugiar_driver.py.

Reference-motion ghost overlay: mjlab renders it natively
(MotionCommandCfg.debug_vis + MjlabViserScene's debug visualization, on by
default in ViserPlayViewer.setup()) — nothing is reimplemented here.

NOT covered by tests/test_driver_family_parity.py, on purpose — see that
file's MJLAB_EXEMPT_DRIVER note: this driver shares no framework with its
Genesis siblings, so a text-identical-bodies check would be meaningless.
