"""
The TrainingBackend descriptor — the shape every training backend in this
package fills in — plus the repo paths those descriptors point at.

A descriptor is data, not a class hierarchy: one frozen dataclass per place
a training job can run, with optional callables for the few things that
genuinely differ (which interpreter, how the subprocess env is prepared,
what this backend refuses). TrainingManager.start() contains ZERO knowledge
of any individual backend — it resolves ONE descriptor and drives its hooks.
See backends/__init__.py for the registry and the "how do I add one" walkthrough.
